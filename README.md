# Introduction
a comprehensive workflow for analyzing bulk RNA-seq data from LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The pipeline begins with raw FASTQ files, which are preprocessed using Trimmomatic to remove adapters and low-quality bases. Quality assessment is performed with FastQC, and MultiQC provides an aggregated overview of all samples, ensuring high-quality data for downstream analysis. High-quality reads are aligned to the human genome using HISAT2, generating count matrices for each sample. In R, the count data are normalized, and differential gene expression is analyzed using DESeq2. Genes are annotated with biotypes, and low-count or zero-count genes are filtered to improve statistical robustness. Principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmaps are generated to assess sample clustering and variation, while volcano plots visualize differentially expressed genes between conditions. The workflow includes detailed gene-level analyses, allowing visualization of normalized expression for individual genes across experimental groups. Functional enrichment and pathway analyses are conducted using ReactomePA and fgsea, highlighting pathways significantly altered under hypoxia. Genes are mapped from Ensembl IDs to Entrez IDs to enable pathway and gene set enrichment analyses, with visualization of top enriched pathways and hallmark gene sets. This repository integrates Bash/Linux commands for preprocessing steps—trimming, quality control, and alignment—with R-based analyses for statistical modeling, visualization, and pathway enrichment. Example data, annotated counts, and scripts are included to facilitate reproducibility and hands-on learning. This pipeline can be easily adapted to other RNA-seq datasets, making it a practical guide for researchers aiming to perform end-to-end RNA-seq analysis from raw reads to biologically meaningful insights. By combining widely used tools such as Trimmomatic, FastQC, MultiQC, HISAT2, and DESeq2, this workflow ensures high-quality, reproducible results. It is ideal for anyone seeking a structured, transparent, and detailed approach to bulk RNA-seq analysis in human cell lines under different experimental conditions.
